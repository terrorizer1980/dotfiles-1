## History

I initially commited to this repository seven years ago, and proceeded to
interminably shave this particular yak. I experimented, failed, and learned.  I
moved from Vim to Neovim to Emacs to Neovim to VS Code and back to Neovim. I
tried different terminals and window managers. I made various improvements
around automation.

An unfortunate hallmark of this journey way was that I never really bothered
with meaningful commit messages. Things were typically just ‚Äúupdated‚Äù or a
‚ÄúWIP‚Äù. This was intentional‚Äîusually I was just trying to get things working the
way I wanted so I could get back to work. I was in pure experimentation mode,
curious and reckless.

Over time, I stopped relying on copy-pasted modifications and became more
thoughtful about edits and updates. I made sure I planned out and understood
what changes I was making and why, but still never put effort into the commit
messages‚Äîperhaps because of the historical precedent, or maybe because I was
always in too much of a rush.

In an effort to keep a more useful change log moving forward, I decided to wipe
out all commits in the [`main`] branch and begin the history anew. For posterity,
all commits made prior to this change are available in the [`archives`] branch.
