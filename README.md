These are my sytem configuration files. Please don’t copy and paste from them,
but please do learn and steal from them. I manage these using [GNU Stow].

Contained herein are my [Neovim] [runtime files] as well as configurations for
other tools I use, such as [kitty], [tmux], and [Zsh]. The intrepid explorer
may also happen upon myriad handy shell scripts.

## History

I initially commited to this repository seven years ago, and proceeded to
interminably shave the proverbial yak. I experimented, failed, and learned. I
moved from Vim to Neovim to Emacs to Neovim to VS Code and back to Neovim. I
tried different terminals and window managers. I made various improvements
around automation.

An unfortunate hallmark of this journey way was that I never really bothered
with meaningful commit messages. Things were typically just “updated” or a
“WIP”. This was intentional—usually I was just trying to get things working the
way I wanted so I could get back to work. I was in pure experimentation mode,
curious and reckless.

Over time, I stopped relying on copy-pasted modifications and became more
thoughtful about edits and updates. I made sure I planned out and understood
what changes I was making and why, but still never put effort into the commit
messages—perhaps because of the historical precedent, or maybe because I was
always in too much of a rush.

In an effort to keep a more useful change log moving forward, I decided to wipe
out all commits in the [`main`] branch and begin the history anew. For posterity,
all commits made prior to this change are available in the [`archives`] branch.
