These are my system configuration files, my dotfiles, my whole setup, my _grimoire_. I realize the term
‚Äúdotfiles‚Äù here is a bit of a misnomer, but c‚Äôest la vie, eh?

If you‚Äôre me and are setting up a new laptop, you‚Äôll want to have a look at
[SETUP.md](https://github.com/ngscheurich/dotfiles/blob/master/SETUP.md).

## Prior art
