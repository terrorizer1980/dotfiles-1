These are my system configuration files, my dotfiles, my whole setup, my _grimoire_. I realize the term
‚Äúdotfiles‚Äù here is a bit of a misnomer, but c‚Äôest la vie, eh?

If you‚Äôre me and are setting up a new laptop, you‚Äôll want to have a look at
[SETUP.md](https://github.com/ngscheurich/dotfiles/blob/master/SETUP.md).

## Prior art

The contents herein have been inspired by lots of other people; I‚Äôll list them here in no particular order as I recall them:

* [Sorin Ionescu](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
* [Trevor Brown](https://github.com/Stratus3D/dotfiles)
* [Mathias Byens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

## Roadmap

* [x] Laptop setup guide
* [ ] Add iTerm2 configs and setup
* [ ] [Create a global .gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore)
* [ ] Add summary of setup script to [SETUP.md](https://github.com/ngscheurich/dotfiles/blob/master/SETUP.md)
* [ ] Increase Finder spring loading delay for directories
* [ ] Dependency on colorize gem seems dumb?
