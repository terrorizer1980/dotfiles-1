#+TITLE: Emacs configuration
#+AUTHOR: Nicholas Scheurich

* Personal information

Tell Emacs a little bit about myself.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq user-full-name "Nicholas Gunther Scheurich"
        user-mail-address "nick@scheurich.me")
#+END_SRC

* Package management

I use the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] macro for all my packagement management needs; it keeps
things neat, tidy, and all in one place. The only prerequisites it requires are
package.el with MELPA added as a source and =use-package= installed
(=M-x package-install use-package=).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)

  (add-to-list
   'package-archives
   '("MELPA" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
  (package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

* Be evil

Vim will always be my first ♥︎. [[https://melpa.org/#/evil][evil]] helps fill the void.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil
    :ensure t
    :config (evil-mode 1))
#+END_SRC
